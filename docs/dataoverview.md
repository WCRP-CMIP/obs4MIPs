## Technical alignment with CMIP

As with CMIP model output, obs4MIPs data products are provided as netCDF files with one variable per file.  The template for obs4MIPs filenames,  described in the obs4MIPs data standards, is as follows:

obs4MIPs file name template =
<variable_id>_<frequency>_<source_id>_<variant_label>_<grid_label>[_<time_range>].nc
e.g., siconc_mon_OSI-SAF-450-a-3-0_PCMDI-BE_gr1_185001-202301.nc

In some cases an entire timeseries is saved as a single file, but for larger datasets timeseries often span across multiple files.
