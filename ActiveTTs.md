 **The obs4MIPs Steering Group is currently prioritizing project enhancments via the following Task Teams:**

TT1: <u>obs4MIPs data specifications (ODS)</u>.  Responsible for detailing the technical specifications ensuring alignment with CMIP model output. ODS are now quite mature but may need to be further refined as CMIP7 is defined.

TT2: <u>Workflow efficiency: Improving workflow for preparing obs4MIPs compliant data.</u>  Improving workflow to prepare/deliver obs4MIPs-compliant data.  Intended to establish a template to enable inclusion of additional information with an obs4MIPs-compliant product (e.g., supporting documentation or data, uncertainty characterization, a forward model to facilitate comparison with standard model output).
 
TT3: <u>Exploring options to include “supplemental information”.</u> Intended to establish a template to enable inclusion of additional information with an obs4MIPs-compliant product (e.g., supporting documentation or data, uncertainty characterization, a forward model to facilitate comparison with standard model output).

TT4: <u>Oversight of dataset suitability indicators.</u>  As described in Waliser et al. (2020, Fig 2A) the intent is to provide information on how well products are technically aligned with CMIP, and how readily they can be used to compare with model output.

TT5: <u>Inclusion of satellite-based exploratory datasets.</u>  Fundamental to a possible expansion of obs4MIPs beyond CMIP-aligned products, this effort involves identifying pathways for including data that are not a close match to existing CMIP standard output, but with additional work/analysis could be valuable for advancing model evaluation, research and development.

TT6: <u>Prototyping the inclusion of in-situ data.</u>  As with exploratory datasets, site data does not fit the original paradigm of obs4MIPs which focused on gridded datasets. However, recommendations for including high frequency site data have been longstanding, and thus a team is currently examining how this could be technically integrated into obs4MIPs.

TT7: <u>Inclusion of selected reanalyses fields.</u>  Several variables from atmospheric reanalysis are routinely used in model evaluation (e.g., state fields) and will continue to be made available via obs4MIPs. With additional support, the obs4MIPs framework could accommodate making reanalysis more broadly available as obs4MIPs products, or the framework could be leveraged by another effort intended to focus on reanalysis products.

TT8: <u>Guidance and capacity building.</u>  Preparation by Steering Panel of content to encourage new dataset proposals and use of obs4MIPs datasets. The CMIP-IPO supports communication and outreach of this content.
