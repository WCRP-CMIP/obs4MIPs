## Obs4MIPs data availability via ESGF

CMIP model output is made available via the [Earth System Grid Federation (ESGF)](https://esgf-node.llnl.gov/projects/esgf-llnl) along with data from other projects including some obs4MIPs.    
Obs4MIPs data published on ESGF is available as a companion project of CMIP via [Metagrid](https://aims2.llnl.gov/search). Currently, efforts are underway to introduce new datasets to obs4MIPs as well as to update existing products.  ESGF is a primary platform for making many obs4MIPs compliant data available.
