Obs4MIPs data published on ESGF is available as a companion project of CMIP via the [via the CoG interface](https://esgf-node.llnl.gov/search/obs4MIPs/) as well as a new interface [Metagrid-beta](https://aims2.llnl.gov/metagrid/search?project=obs4MIPs)). Currently, efforts are underway to introduce new datasets to obs4MIPs as well as to update existing products.  ESGF is a primary platform for making many obs4MIPs compliant data available.
