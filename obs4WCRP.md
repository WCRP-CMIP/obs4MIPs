# Obs4MIPs in WCRP

From 2011 to the end of 2020, the WCRP’s Data Advisory Council advanced coordination between the diverse observational and data analysis efforts across the program.  This included the establishment of obs4MIPs as a targeted project to improve how observational products are used for CMIP model evaluation and research.   The current obs4MIPs interim steering group is working with [the WGCM Infrastructure Panel](https://www.wcrp-climate.org/wgcm-cmip/wip) and [the CMIP IPO](https://wcrp-cmip.org/cmip-governance/project-office/) to relay recommendations for the project’s future to the new Scientific Steering Group of WCRP's Earth System Modelling and Observations (ESMO).
